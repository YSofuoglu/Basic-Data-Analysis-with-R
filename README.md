# Basic-Data-Analysis-with-R
This script is intended to practice the basics of data analysis on a case study from Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study by using R programming language.

A bike-share company’s historical trip data of 12 months of 2022 is given. The data is appropriate for the purposes of this case study and will enable us to answer the business questions.

We’ll conduct simple analysis to answer the question “How do annual members and casual riders use the company’s bikes differently?” and identify trends.
